## Code of Conduct

### Blog reflections

- We recognize that blog posts are public and so will write our posts with respect for the many viewpoints of readers who might find them
- We will speak for ourselves and not in an official capacity for the institutions we are affiliated with
- We agree to share only our own reflections in blog posts we author
- We will consider class discussions as confidential by default; if we would like to post our ideas in conversation with others' ideas, we will ask permission first and indicate that permission in our posts


### Team research projects

- We agree to reach consensus within our teams about the extent to which we will share our team research publicly
