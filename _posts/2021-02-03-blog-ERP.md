Andy is really doing a great job. He added a hyperlink, see markdown refs for how to add this.  He also added a really cool figure and he used the img markdown and added to a folder, so that image is avaiable too all of you. You can do this too.  He is happy to help on how to so this.  Main this is to do your post here.  Then go thorugh the git staging commit and pushing process.
