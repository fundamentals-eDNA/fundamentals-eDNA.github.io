Title: week 7 reflection

This week we focused on library preparation and the use of universal primers for metagenomic sequencing. Both subjects are new to me and I am still pretty confused about library preparation. I was surprised to read in this weekâ€™s reading that universal primers can vary significantly and there is no one-size-fits-all primer for a given taxonomic group. For example: CO1 libraries tend to be more robust than 12S libraries, however, Collins et al. (2019) found that despite the low quality libraries, 12S MiFish primers are more accurate than CO1 in picking up fish DNA. This is confusing for me because my assumption is that more data and available reference sequences would lead to better barcode matching. At the time this paper was written, 12S libraries only accounted for 56-62% fish species as opposed to CO1 which ranged from 95-97%. Regardless of the low library resolution, the 12S MiFish primers overlapped with the most fish species collected by traditional survey methods like seining. 
One glimmer of hope in all this confusion is that Maine-eDNA is already using 12S MiFish primers for fish rather than CO1. I hope that the 12S libraries have become more robust in the last few years since this publication.
