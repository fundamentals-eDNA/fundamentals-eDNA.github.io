Reflection week 8 blog post

I wasn't overly excited about this week's topics coming in to it; I have some experience with bioinformatics based in the command line using QIIME and hadn't put much thought into backups or data safety.  Most of my assignments and work are done on Google drive and I honestly didn't think about anyone wanting to take my data.  But honestly after our discussions this week I plan to make a lot of changes to my current data storage methods.  I now understand the importance of having more than one backup.  Furthermore, my computer password is only required after 3 hours of inactivity, so I plan to change that to help protect my information better.  Encryption still seems kind of scary, so I need to do more research on that and decide if I can do that.

I also wanted to say that Andy, Alex, Rachel, and Zach did an excellent job at organizing the bioinformatics tutorial we did.  Even in workshops where I've worked in someone else's environment or on a VM, there are always unexpected errors, files aren't in the right place, explanation isn't very clear, etc.  This was, without a doubt, the best and most organized bioinformatics trial I've ever done, so thank you! I'm excited to try this with my own data one day.
