description: Zachary's reflection on Emerging eDNA Methods
---

The topic of the week is eDNA methods and using LAMP. The point of using LAMP has some interesting applications and it can be used without a thermocycler like normal PCR. Using this method, we are continuing the strand of DNA instead of copying sections of it. A very different way to get results compared to other methods (considering the questions!). The differences include the number of primers to use, to make a continuous loop of DNA. This is a very unique way and the uses can be very interesting in the eDNA field.

The papers this week contain rapid testing through a couple species in Michigan. It's extremely worth noting that these tests are important for invasive species. These quick tests can improve the way that detection methods for preventative measures. We discussed assay creating and primer design. To see what we can do with this process but obviously depends on the question. Species detection is important and the idea behind eDNA and the technology is determined by the question.

We also discussed how this process being so rapid to detect viruses and/or invasive species (relating to original paper and thought).
