I really enjoyed this week because we covered an interesting eDNA debate (OTU’s vs ASV’s), but also learned from our classmates about the very practical (and slightly terrifying) topic of data management. In a sense, the paired discussion and lecture were archetypal of this course experience as a whole: a balance between eDNA content and peer-to-peer learning. 

I thought the presenters clearly showed the scope and limitations of OTU’s vs. ASV’s. Andy’s lecture on Monday also provided important context about bioinformatics and the somewhat complicated path/decision making process from eDNA to species identification. Overall, however, the data management discussion was probably the most impactful; possibly because it led me to reassess my own data management practices, but also because it accentuated the lack of data management training for SMS students. I think they did an excellent job presenting the options available and feel that other graduate students could benefit from this type of information.
