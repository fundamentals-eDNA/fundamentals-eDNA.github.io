Thank you to this week’s group for starting an interesting discussion on data management. Data management was not discussed much during my undergraduate outside of accessing files more easily in R or in ArcGIS, so I found it especially valuable. I thought it was a great wake-up call for me and how I’ve been managing my data. I haven’t backed up my computer in over a year, which given the horror stories shared during the discussion, is in of itself quite horrifying!  In addition to keeping backups, I’ll be working on organizing my desktop and files to make information easier to find. At this point in time, I don’t have much data for my thesis; however, I know it will get overwhelming and messy fast if I don’t start managing it better! 

I appreciated the time spent walking through a bioinformatics workflow in dada2. This demo helped me better understand what is actually happening at each step and why that step is being performed. I’m looking forward to using this going forward, perhaps with bacterial metabarcoding!
