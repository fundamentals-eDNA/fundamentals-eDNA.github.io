The papers we discussed this week covered eDNA collection and extraction techniques. One paper, Deiner et al. (2015) provided an overview of various methods and their respective strengths and weaknesses in detecting four aquatic species. I appreciated the summary of protocols and the recommendations provided for effectively assessing biodiversity within the samples. Although this wasn’t a popular view among the class, I really enjoyed the Foote et al. (2012) paper regarding harbor porpoise eDNA detections from the Baltic Sea. Were the methods perfect? No. Have any of the papers’ methods been perfect? No. It is a fairly “old” paper in the world of eDNA, but this study considered many variables that seem to be excluded from some of the other eDNA studies from around this time. I was impressed they were able to detect any DNA from such small samples, particularly because of the volume and conditions of the sampling source. The authors met their objective and provided an entertaining (they included pictures!) paper. I was also impressed by the author’s efforts to eliminate contamination within their samples, the use of echolocation to verify detections, and the overall transparency of their paper.
