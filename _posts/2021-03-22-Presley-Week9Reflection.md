This week’s class, we discussed emerging technologies in the field of eDNA. We discussed two different papers by Lee (2017) and Williams et al. (2017). The paper by Lee (2017) describes LAMP, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification, and how it differs from PCR. This paper also delves into its applications and the pros and cons of this emerging technology. This paper gives a good overview of LAMP. This method is a new amplification technology that was originally developed by Notomi et al. (2000). It is an alternative method to PCR. LAMP seems like it would be a beneficial technology to use at remote field sites since it does not require as much equipment or supplies as PCR. Additionally, LAMP is very quick compared to PCR, which can be very useful in emergency situations. One of the most impressive things to me about LAMP is how rapid a researcher can get results (~1hr vs multiple hours). The paper by Williams et al. (2017) describes their study in which they implemented LAMP to detect Dreissena spp., which includes the well-known invasive zebra mussel. It was used to rapidly detect the presence of these organisms. Their LAMP method was sensitive and specific enough for successful detection.

We discussed the following questions:
- Given the advantages and disadvantages of LAMP vs. PCR, what do you think these are when applied to eDNA work? I think LAMP would be useful for researchers that have remote study sites and do not have access to a traditional lab that contains all of the specialty scientific equipment that most researchers use on a daily basis (ie. centrifuge, thermocycler, etc.). 
- Have you used LAMP or do you want to use LAMP? I have never used LAMP, but it seems like a interesting technology that could be applied in multiple different situations. 
- How could you see working this into a project that involves community science? I think with adequate training and testing, community scientists could implement this new technology. LAMP could be a very useful asset in community science projects because of its lower equipment and supplies requirements.
