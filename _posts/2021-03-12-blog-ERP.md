Reflection week 7 blog post

This week was really interesting because I never learned about what actually happens inside of a sequencer.  I've used a MiSeq before and added on the adaptors, but now I understand the purpose of them as well as the lawn of oligos to make bridges of the target DNA.  I think until my Ph.D., I've been oblivious to how the techniques that I use actually work; if they work then don't question it.  I still wonder what the purpose of PhiX is in context of sequencing because we used to use a lot of PhiX (up to 60%) if the sequencer wasn't working well.  There is still a lot I'd like to learn and hopefully once the pandemic has calmed down, we can have workshops with the MiSeq at the CORE.

Interestingly, discussion this week also made the theme 2 folks realize that some of the primers we are using might not be best for the taxa we want to look at.  I'm interested in invertebrates and COI is usually pretty good for that, but the index sites are not being barcoded with COI.  The kelp forest crew at Bigelow is going to chat about how they can improve detection of invertebrates, but I may do separate COI sequencing for my target taxa.  Without class this week, this discussion may not have come up.
