Reflection week 5 blog post

This week's discussion and readings were very relevant to the current progress of our grant as we're still trying to finalize which extraction kit to use.  Furthermore, my group for the research project in this class have differing opinions on which extraction kits are best to use.  Luckily, Sydney (one of my group members) and I were in the same breakout room for discussion so we were able to discuss our preferences in the context of the Deiner paper.  I used the Deiner paper and others to justify the use of the DNeasy blood and tissue kit in my master's thesis, but several PI's on the current project are partial to the Power Water (PW) kit.  My opinions were definitely biased by this paper and I had a pretty negative opinion of the PW kit, but our small group discussions helped me realize that even within eDNA projects, some kits work better than others for your specific sample.  Tying this into the larger discussion, it seems almost impossible to standardize collection and extraction methods because, depending on the goal of your project, the lysis and purification steps may need to be different for different sample types (i.e. diatoms, animal cells, etc.).  This complicates the general goals of this eDNA project, at least consistent usage of kits should help with consistent results.  At least for our individual theses, I believe we should use the same kit throughout our own experiments to make our lives a little bit easier when it comes to data analysis.
