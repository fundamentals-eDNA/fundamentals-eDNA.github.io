Reflection week 4 blog post

The readings this week really made me reflect on work in my own laboratory and think about potential for future projects.  For example, one of the master's students in my lab studies green crabs and has found that their eDNA is really only detectable near the bottom of the water column, but based on this reading and our discussion I'm wondering if the signal she got is from sediment and particulate matter rather than eDNA in the water column?  While we can't go back and re-sample for her experiments, it is something I will consider in my future research.  Two specific things I will consider are using a van dorn bottle (suggested by Rachel) to sample horizontally rather than vertically, and taking pictures of filters once all of the liquid has gone through.  Although I'm sure the color of the filtrate changes as you go up and down in the water column, if the filter from a sample near the benthos is really brown looking, perhaps it will need to be excluded from the results, or at least might explain some of the variation seen.  One thing is for sure after this week, we can never be too careful when it comes to eDNA research, there are opportunities to mess it up everywhere!
