I had a really great time talking about extraction and collection techniques with everyone this week!! Discussion always really get my brain thinking in ways that I hadn't thought about before, and gives me new perspective and ideas on how to solve problems. Choosing an extraction technique that is good for your particular research has something that I've personally debated and struggled with during my masters, so it was nice to get some perspective as to how other people have fared and to read more in depth on some of the literature from the beginning of the field. 

I look forward to continued discussions like we had this week, and thanks everyone for your input!! :)
