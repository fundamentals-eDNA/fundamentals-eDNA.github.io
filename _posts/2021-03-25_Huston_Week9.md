	This week’s readings regarding LAMP were really interesting. I found the shorter synthesis to be very well written and truly appreciated its lack of jargon and use of analogies. LAMP, PCR, DNA, all these things a sort of stigma around them that can be somewhat intimidating to others and can certainly be difficult to understand. I thought the synthesis did a great job at using layman’s terms which is huge for scientific communication to the general public. I also thought both papers did a great job at targeting ecologists and conservationists who may want the benefits of molecular biology but don’t have the background or access to a lab to conduct traditional PCR. 
    A question I have however is what the difference is, in application, between LAMP and BIOMEME. I will look into answering this question but would also be interested in seeing a comparison between the two is efficiency and accuracy.
