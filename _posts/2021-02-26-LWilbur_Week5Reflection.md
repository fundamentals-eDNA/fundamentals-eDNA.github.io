It's exciting to be getting into the details of how eDNA can be collected, stored, and extracted.  The more we discussed the Deiner et al. (2015) paper, the more questions I had about collection protocols for my own project.  Which filter type should I use?  How will I either filter samples in the field or keep collected water cold enough for transport?  Should I try collecting eDNA in a sediment trap or activated carbon instead of just from the water column?  How can I maximize eDNA yield in order to increase detection probability? 

We also discussed the difficulties of standardizing collection methods within the field, and even within a project.  There are many hurdles to standardizing methods within large projects like Maine eDNA, and establishing detailed methods early on is key.  It is also important to communicate methods clearly to project members, especially in the era of COVID.  This is one consequence of the pandemic that seems to have influenced multiple projects. Because of the new normal of solo fieldwork, it can be more difficult for project members to realize when they are collecting data differently.  Data collection methods that may once have been taught in a group setting may now be interpreted on an individual basis.  Frequent communication, as well as having detailed methods before data collection starts, can help prevent discrepancies.
