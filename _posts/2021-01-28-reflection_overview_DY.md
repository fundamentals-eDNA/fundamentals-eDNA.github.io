I really like the idea that eDNA has its own ecology (depicted in Figure 2 from [Cristescu and Hebert 2018](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110617-062306)) that we have to consider when analyzing it. It's not like there's an impartial record of biodiversity hiding out there in eDNA---the record is imperfect and biased and our analyses must account for that

I also appreciated that we could think about different perspectives on genetics research. It's important to remember that while I might be excited by the prospects of genetics technology to unlock biodiversity data, other people have experienced genetics research as exploitative and colonial. Reading [TallBear (2013)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43284191?seq=1) was a great introduction to some of those perspectives.  I also wanted to share a nice [essay](http://carte-blanche.org/hiyoge-owisisi-tanga-ita-cricket-egg-stories/) I was reminded of during our discussion. In it Dr. Katherine Crocker narrates some of her experience of being Indigenous in science.
