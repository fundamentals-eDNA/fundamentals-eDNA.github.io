This week we discussed isothermal loop-mediated amplification, also known as LAMP. Our group chose this emerging technology because it offers an alternative to PCR or qPCR that does not require the use of a thermocycler and produces rapid, specific results. LAMP is extensively used to detect pathogens and viruses, for example in COVID-19 rapid tests. It also has important applications in the field, and is a powerful tool for invasive species detection. 

While there are many positives to this technology, LAMP is complicated by the need for 4-6 primers and a significant portion of our class discussion focused on how LAMP compares to PCR (for example cost, quantitative detection, error rate, etc.) Overall, LAMP is a streamlined protocol with the potential for interesting applications in citizen science. Used in conjunction with other technologies like PCR and qPCR to validate or strengthen results, LAMP is a tool that could be easily used to include the community in DNA analysis in the context of marine long-term monitoring programs.
