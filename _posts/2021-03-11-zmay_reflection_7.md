A recurring theme to some of these paper that keeps me going is how they are specific to the question. It's obvious that we want to answer our own questions , but the way that these experiments continue to be set up has that mindset. It is very important in choosing which region and how many bps that scientists want to examine. Each locale and type of region is specific to the type of organism and shows a great deal about the methods and practice or trial and error (some time ago, since this is becoming less of a novel idea with the increased testing as well as cost effectiveness...). It is however important to note that these experiments are trying every combination of steps, including universal primers and many different regions in the genome not necessarily pinpointed in some of these research topics. FOr example using 12S or 18S or CO1 etc. It is incredible that the technology advancements that we are using today can yield us so much information, depending on how we use it.
