Learning about LAMP was interesting. Discussing the advantages and disadvantages were similar to all other methods. In a few years, once this method is more developed and tweaked more, I think it will be very useful especially for field work. The microfluidic devices were the most interesting to me because the end goal of my research is to create an intestine-on-a-chip for ruminants (yes, we have a guy to help with the physics because I do not understand it either). The lab-on-a-chip idea is intriguing and with more exposure and development it could change the entire way research is done. I also think that community science is important, and many large studies would not be able to be done without it. Learning about new technologies is always cool, but often it is hard to incorporate into your own research because it might be more expensive, more confusing because it is new, and it might also not work as well if the fine details are not worked out yet.
