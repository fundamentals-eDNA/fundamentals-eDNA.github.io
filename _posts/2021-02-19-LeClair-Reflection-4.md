This week, we discussed a new source of eDNA - fine particulate matter. Since DNA is charged (negatively I think?), it sticks to other items in the environment - including clay, cellular material, plant matter, etc. Because of this, stored soil samples and filters with particulate material could provide eDNA for retroactive studies. While this is pretty fascinating to think about, I do wonder how much eDNA is actually free-floating/not attached to particulate matter. It would be interesting to determine if more turbid water could hold onto more DNA in the water column, though this would also clog filters more quickly... so perhaps the benefit wouldn't be as apparent. Nonetheless, interesting to think about!
