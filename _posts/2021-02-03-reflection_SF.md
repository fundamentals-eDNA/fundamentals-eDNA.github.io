Cristescu & Hebert, 2018 seemed to focus on the more qualitative aspect of eDNA and metabarcoding as a biodiversity monitoring tool rather than using eDNA for absolute quantification. eDNA seems like the wild west. To answer ecologically interesting questions, we need to accept many assumptions about eDNA (degradation, retention, etc.). It seems we are at the point scientifically where researchers are accepting beliefs or accepting biases to use eDNA to its “fullest” potential. In the end, it will never be the catchall. It will just be another tool in scientists’ toolbox.

With eDNA being a wild west, and we are learning just how powerful and sensitive it is, we could be capture all sorts of DNA from a variety of organisms, including humans. This idea of using DNA to describe or group people was highlighted in TallBear, 2013. eDNA could be a field thrust into the ethical spotlight. These days massive companies are soliciting DNA samples, researchers scan the globe for “rare” or “Indigenous” DNA. While we as researchers are trying to look for the invasion of black sea bass in the Gulf of Maine, we might capture a whole lot more…
