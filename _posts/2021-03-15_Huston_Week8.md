title: OTU v ASV

This week’s readings touched on the topics of data management as well as the selection between de novo OTUs, closed-reference OTUs, or ASVs. Regarding data management, I always knew that it was essential but didn’t realize that it/its explanation were necessary for certain proposals. It makes me think, could larger grant-awarding organizations (like the NSF) include certain requirements or specifications about how sequence data is stored, archived, or regularly compared against (respective) reference databases?

It seems like so much potential data is lost or disregarded once it becomes an OTU. It would be amazing if, instead of being discarded, this data could be compared against other sequences and eventually its mystery could be uncovered, and it can be given a more concrete classification. Perhaps this is why ASVs should be better used. While they have their limitations, they definitely seem to have benefits outweighing de novo or closed-reference OTUs. Considering the improvements that have already been made in molecular biology and bioinformatics, I am curious and excited to see how much further they are developed in the years to come.
