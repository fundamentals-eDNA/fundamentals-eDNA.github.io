This week we discussed module 3 - study design and introduction to data management. In the class, we reviewed multiple competing hypotheses (MCH), definitions of “sample” and “replicate,” and occupancy models. The study by De Souza et al. (2016) examines the effect of seasonality on detection in eDNA samples for the Black Warrior Waterdog and the Flattened Musk Turtle in Alabama, USA. They found that it is important to incorporate life history knowledge of target species into study designs that use eDNA sampling methods. Less sampling is needed when target species are more active (i.e. only 4 water samples are needed for 95% detection rate for the Flattened Musk Turtle during the warm season when this turtle species is most active). Additionally, this study found both species in newly recorded locations using eDNA sampling methods.
