This is ZMay's Test_1


Reflection:


The readings this first week were a great way to start the semester. A simple yet complex overview of how DNA research has advanced throughout the decades and the processes that were discovered was very interesting. The amount of work that has come before our time in this specific project where we plan to ask and answer questions involving these techniques and breakthroughs is unprecedented. The abstract states these methods will help in "enabling the census of species" is profound and enticing that helps to understand just how important our research will be doing to the science community involving the biodiversity of the planet. TallBear's paper also brings a new light how to move forward in this program. My definition of 'articulation' in terms of science and what we as a cohort are doing is to decide how to ask questions. We have an entire 'toolbox' at our disposal, and we need to learn how to use the tools that are available as well as what tool(s) that we need to complete the jobs or to find out what project is next. This comes back to how we interpret the idea of DNA and that it can mean different things. Perspective is key and using multiple (collaborative measures) will prevail in this adventure.
