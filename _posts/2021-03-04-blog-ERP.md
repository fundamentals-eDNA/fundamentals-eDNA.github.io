Reflection week 6 blog post

I feel like every week I say that every lecture is really relevant to my thesis, but this weeks was the best yet!  I am currently designing species specific primers for invasive invertebrates and am struggling with a few species.  Regarding databases, I didn't realize that GenBank is "the wild west" and that better online databases exist for creating primers.  Furthermore, I didn't know much about other softwares for designing primers; I've used IDT primerquest and Primer3, but we learned about other tools in class and I actually learned from Sam that Benchling contains Primer3, so not only was the lesson helpful, the conversation was also really helpful.  Regarding the paper discussion, I think it really highlighted patterns in COVID-19 research.  Due to the novelty of the virus, methods and research came together quickly to address the questions and save lives.  Some of those methods were not perfect, but came together out of need to save lives.  For these reasons it was not surprising that the COVID-19 primers designed were less than perfect, but it serves as a good lesson for our own research.  There are a lot of ways we can optimize our primer sets and it is important to do so to increase reproducability of our results.
