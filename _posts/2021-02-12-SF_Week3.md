This was my first time taking a deeper dive into occupancy modeling. However, I was familiar that an organism's biology and the surrounding environment will influence detection rates.I have multiple questions surround thisâ€¦ What aspectsof an organism's biology are most important to understand detection rates? In marine systems, what are the most critical environmental factors to measure or consider? As researchers, if we don't know much about our study organism, would the first step be to test shedding rates in mesocosms? Should we just risk it and make assumptions? Would occupancy modeling change if scientists were trying to detect a roving organisms (Fish) vs. a static organism (kelp)? Would it be recommended to purchase an IPC to check for inhibition from, say FisherSci, or would you design your own to save money? (hoping to design my own)
