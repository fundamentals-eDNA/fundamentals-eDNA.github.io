description: Zachary's reflection on Bioinformatics and Data Management
---

This week was discussion data management and dada pipeline. Being safe and secure in how one protects and copies their data is important. There should be multiple files and copies that include a few onsite and offsite wheres of the data. Verification logons were also discussed as well as multiple cloud services and VPNs. 

The ASV and OTU paper was very interesting in how they differ but help answer a certain question. I do not like the arbitrary number of 3%, but I do know that in using similar programs for bioinformatics that the process and will work. I do find it insane that there are only subtle differences in these two measures and that the end result will be different. I do think that now that we have the technology to use programs such as R and the dada pipeline that these should both be examined when looking at bioinformatics.
