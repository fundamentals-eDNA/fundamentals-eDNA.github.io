It was interesting to read about the earlier days of eDNA in the deSouza et al. paper. Even today, seasonality is not given as much consideration as it should deserve in many eDNA studies, and seasonality itself can be highly organism- and location-specific. Some of my classmates shared observations about the unique difficulties in working with specific taxa, such as rare herptiles and crustaceans. 

Nevertheless, the paper had several flaws that must be considered when it comes to project design for our own theses. Seasonality was poorly defined in this study, and seasonality in turn has effects on differences in environmental physicochemical parameters that affect the ecology of eDNA, such as tannin inhibition from leaves in fall, and differences in flow rates across the seasons. Is there a distinct temperature threshold where biological activity is altered? It is critical to make use of appropriate environmental and biological data when making such blanket definitions. 
While less well understood at the time of the study, the ecology of one's study organism cannot be viewed in isolation from the ecology of eDNA, which must be constrained as best as possible by accounting for confounding variables. 

It is also critical to be consistent when it comes to sampling methodology, although I am of the opinion that any usable related data should not be 'wasted' even if it was conducted under a different methodology, with caveats. 

In addition, given the relative ease of measuring physicochemical parameters these days (e.g. with sondes), we should collect as much of such data as feasible, instead of making too many assumptions about physical environmental parameters as in this study (e.g. not directly measuring flow rate, but perhaps using slope as a proxy for flow rate)

While less appropriate to my own research at the moment, we also discussed the challenges of habitat suitability modelling, and the importance of ensuring that the spatial and temporal scale of the datasets used is appropriate.
