Why is extracting DNA from water so simple yet so hard? When I first started this program, I fell into the trap of scrutinizing the difference between extract kits; as Erin pointed out, these “pilot” tests between extraction kits are never a quick and easy thing. The Rasher Lab has been working on an extraction kit for almost a year… We can easily get sucked into the rabbit hole to answer these types of methods development questions. I try and keep it in perspective that I want to use eDNA as a tool to ask and answer interesting ecological questions. While deciding what kit to use is essential and may impact my data, it isn’t my primary question. At the end of the day, it seems we need to make some assumptions. Extraction kits should be used based on the types of questions each researcher is asking. Labs should test those extraction methods, look to the literature, and make an informed decision. At that point, there isn’t much more a person can do.
