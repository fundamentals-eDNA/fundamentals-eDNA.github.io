This weekâ€™s group discussion was an eye-opener. It was a good reminder that having a laissez-faire attitude to cybersecurity and data management will fail. I think the password thing is the hardest. These days companies like Apple or Google try and streamline logins by remembering password information. This efficiency also makes repeating passwords all too easy. I need to diversify my passwords. I also liked the group's emphasis on data backups, especially on the cloud. With science becoming more collaborative, how does a researcher manage all the different shared spaces like Dropbox and Google Drive? When starting a collaboration, when does data management and storage get talked about?
