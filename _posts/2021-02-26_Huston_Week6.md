	If the covid-19 pandemic were the wild west, then the authors of this paper are the sheriff and deputies trying to keep order. The number of detection protocols that have been developed and implemented without optimization is astonishing and alarming. I can’t believe that many such methods don’t share their primer design or protocols – that is, until this paper. The work accomplished by these authors is beneficial, not only because it can more accurately detect covid-19, but because they shared their data and primers so that everything could be easily replicated/used by any lab with access to a thermocycler. 
Last week we touched on the idea of standardizing protocols and methods and how it could be hard to do so at a large scale. Though it would be difficult to do so, I believe the world would benefit greatly if all covid-19 detection protocols were standardized using these author’s primer sets and methodology. 
Regarding my own research, this paper as well as Monday's lecture really made me think about the primer sets I will be using. The UMaine CORE facility already has alewife specific primers, but have they been extensively tested and optimized? Knowing Geneva, they probably have, but that is definitly something I will have to explore to find out more!
