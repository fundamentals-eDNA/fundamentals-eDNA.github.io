	This week’s readings and topic really resonated with me as I am beginning my sample collection process and planning for the upcoming extraction period. Regarding extractions, I find myself somewhat lucky that I am working with sediments. Of the multiple extraction kits out there, it seems straight forward to pick one already optimized for soil extractions. Thankfully, through literature review I know that this (using a soil specific kit) is truth and not an assumption. But it does bring up a good point on how for water samples one could use a PowerWater Kit, Blood and Tissue Kit, PowerSoil Kit, etc., all of which depends on your target question and organisms. 
	One thing that stuck out to me in this week’s Deiner et al., reading was that as one of their tests, the authors compared filter versus precipitation methods for eubacterial detection, knowing (having previously stated in their introduction) that eubacteria would not be caught as well in their 0.7 um filters. The authors do mention that one could increase eubacterial detection by adding salts to enhance bonding, but couldn’t one achieve the same result though using a smaller pore size? I guess I would have liked to see an additional analysis comparing yields between filtration through a smaller pore size versus precipitation. 
	Either way, as scientists we want to contribute the best and most accurate data. As a result, optimized collection, extraction, and overall study design must always be on our minds to ensure we are doing our best.
