description: Zachary's reflection on Collection/Detection

These two papers were great representations of how eDNA is evolving. Both the collection and detection have changed throughout the novel (novel) approaches of eDNA. 15ml for species detection in 2012/2015 to nearly 4L in our study. It does show that even small amounts of a water sample can provide enough DNA for detection, of course using the correct probe and assay. I found it interesting that while performing the porpoise study that they were concerned about the wind, wave and ocean currents, even in a more controlled environment. Obviously these have an affect on the eDNA, location, dilution, and degredation as compared to freshwater systems. It is amazing to see these studies and how far they have come to better our understanding of eDNA and the uses and detection methods. It is apparent that the many methods that can be used in these projects is continuing to grow.
