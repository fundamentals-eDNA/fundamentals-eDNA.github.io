As a student new to eDNA and genetics in general, this week was informative in providing a little background of the uses and interpretations of eDNA and genetic material. It was surprising to hear a consensus among students that there was concern about the lack of involvement of eDNA science in legislative action; despite growing use of eDNA in science there seems to be a multitude of uncertainties resting around the technique (uncertainties in data interpretation like false positives/negatives, lack of standardization amongst researchers), which will further cause delays in utilization of eDNA research in management actions. Interpretability of eDNA and genetic material also rests further on definitions and articulations of the investigation topic. The articulations of what indigeneity is differs greatly between indigenous communities, and a genetic articulation, which raised another point of how we define communities and what “belongs”. In my breakout group, we brought up species hybridization and how we would identify those species if found in a water sample. We also discussed if there was discharge from an aquarium upstream, would we include those species as part of the analysis of a river, because their DNA is found in the water, or would we have to selectively pick those species out, and if by some miracle those species are in the water, how would we test against that? There were a lot of questions revolving around uncertainties in eDNA, and I look forward to exploring these uncertainties and developing my knowledge of eDNA in this course.
