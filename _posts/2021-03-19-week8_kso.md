title: Week 8 Reflection - Bioinformatics
description: Reflection on the eighth week of EES 590, discussing bioinformatics.

This week we discussed bioinformatics and how one can use them for evaluating sequences containing lots of information and millions of DNA reads. The matching process of sequences to the reference database depends on methods that the user chooses (distance based, or model based approaches), and thus the results will differ as well. I found it interesting how even without a reference database, clustering can be used to form Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs); clustering caught my attention because I was able to visualize how that would look if I were to run something similar. 

The discussion on Wednesday was also an interesting one, where we discussed data management. I was excited and happy to discuss something often overlooked in classes, although very important. Hearing about the different methods of data management my peers use made me look at my own methods with a more focused eye. Another very interesting class week. Looking forward to finishing up and getting ramped up on our group projects!
