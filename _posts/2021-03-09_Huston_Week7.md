This week’s reading on primer specificity/comparison by Collins et al., (2019) was very insightful and informative. Prior to starting the Maine-eDNA fellowship, I had done work using various primer sets, but was more of a “science jock” as opposed to your more stereotypical “nerd”. By this, I mean I knew how to perform the task, get a job done, and get results, but I was ignorant as to the science behind each step and the careful thought that must be put into primer and marker design and selection. In fact, I recall testing different (versions?) of CO1 primers: CO1, CO1-degenerate, and folmer-CO1. Back then, I knew I was testing to see which primer led to the best amplification and subsequent band, but I didn’t know the mechanism behind primer design, until now. 
Regarding primers for eDNA analysis, I – as well as many others – wish there was 1 panacea primer that melded specificity, richness, etc. While this primer “cure-all” doesn’t exist yet and may never exist, great steps are being made using CO1 and the more recent MiFish. For my own future research, I see the benefit of using the MiFish as well as CO1 to get a blanket understanding of general biodiversity. However, now I am hoping that the sediment I am working with doesn’t contain too many microbes that potentially wash out any other signatures using the CO1 primer set.
