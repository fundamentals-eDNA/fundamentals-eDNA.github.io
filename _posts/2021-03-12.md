I was impressed by the high species richness and high reproducibility rates of the MiFish primers (and as Dara had mentioned, a reference library with a whopping 72% of Gulf of Maine fishes!). It sounds like a well-designed primer set! MiFish also had decent overlap in species detected with metabarcoding and with visual survey; however, there isn't as much overlap between species dected by the two survey types as I had expected. This comparison illustrates biases in species detected with different methods. My personal experience with metabarcoding is with microbial communities- bacteria and phytoplankton. Metabarcoding samples of these microbes contain the entire organism, while metabarcoding larger organisms relies on shed DNA in tissues or waste. Metabarcoding is such a useful tool for assesing community composition, especially when taxa of interest are cryptic or difficult to observe; while visual surveys would be better for detecting organisms with difficult to extract DNA or easily degradable tissues. It is always nice to read about the applications and challenges of methods in a different system of study! I enjoyed presenting on Collins et al. (2019) with Sam Tan and Emily Pierce. Thank you all for a great discussion this week!
